When it comes to image sensor testing, Photon Transfer Curve(PTC) is one of the most frequently metioned metrics. Be that as it may, there is a lot of misunderstanding and confusion around what exactly it means, how it is measured, or why it is even a thing. This article aims to provide an explanation regarding the subject in an easily understandable manner.

<h2>
    Schrödinger's Cat
</h2>

We are going to start with some **very elementary** understanding of quantum mechanics.
<br>![The two states](/assets/images/elgato.png)<br>
The story about Schrödinger's cat is widely known so we'll use it as an example. An oversimplified explanation goes as this:
1. There are two possible states: \|A> and \|B>
2. The two states can exist simultaneously (quantum superposition/entanglement): \|A>+\|B>
3. The state gets decided with an observation (wave function collapse): \|A>+\|B> -> A

So how does this relate to image sensors? Instead of observing a cat, the sensor detects light(i.e. emission of a photon).
<br>![Photon excitation](/assets/images/excitation.png)<br>
What is light that we see? How is it made?
When an electron is in an excited state, the electron can emit a photon and fall to lower energy state. This emission of a photon is the light we observe.
Observing this Schrödinger's photon is not so different from observing a cat.
1. An excited electron has either emitted a photon, or not.
2. The two forementioned states can exist simultaneously.
3. The image sensor observes and decides the state.

Why is this important? We can now reduce the complicated quantum mathematics into a really simple model; We either detect a photon, or not. In other words, the whole process comes down to just a weighted coinflip. You don't have to worry about whether light is a particle or a wave.

<h2>
    Multiple Photons
</h2>
We are not exactly interested in counting a single photon here though. With image sensors we detect multiple photons at once. This can be compared to multiple coinflips,

<br>![equation 2](/assets/images/eq2.PNG)<br>
which follows the binomial distribution that we all know of(hopefully...).
<br>![equation 3](/assets/images/eq3.PNG)<br>

In reality, the scale of this problem is quite different from normal coinflips that we can imagine. The weight of a coinflip is so unfavorable that, there are countless number of electrons attempting countless trials of emission in the short time span we measure, and only a tiny fraction of them is successfully detected as photons in the sensor. This fact warps the distribution into a very specific shape.

<br>![equation 4](/assets/images/eq4.PNG)<br>
Fortunately for us, there is a name for this specific probability distribution: Poisson distribution. And even the variance has a name: Shot noise.

<h2>
    SNR
</h2>
If you have been following closely, you may have noticed that shot noise itself comes from an inherent nature of physics and statistics unrelated to sensors. Therefore there is no way to reduce shot noise without bending the law of physics. However, what we can do is to increase signal to noise ratio(SNR) which has indirect effect of reducing the portion of noise.

<br>![equation 5](/assets/images/eq5.PNG)<br>
In short, the more the photons we measure the higher the SNR gets because signal grows faster than noise. This is also why darker images tend to be grainy and noisy. Therefore pixels that can collect more photons at once(called full well capacity) can achieve better image quality.

<h2>
    Conversion Gain
</h2>

When we take digital images, we measure relative intensity instead of absolute numbers of photons(unless we use SPAD). So if we want to know how many photons we are measuring with an unknownsensor, what should we do? 
<br>![equation 6](/assets/images/eq6.PNG)<br>
The above is assumed true, because image sensors output is designed to be linear(or at least trying their best to). If we know the ratio between digital output and actual number of photons, we can reverse calculate the number of photons using only the output. So how do we measure conversion gain? Do you remember how shot noise is inherent to statistics and only decided by the number of photons? We can utilize that property.
<br>![equation 7](/assets/images/eq7.PNG)<br>
We use two facts that we proved above.
1. Distribution of photon numbers that are measured follows Poisson distribution.
2. The mean value and the variance value of Poisson distribution is same(λ).
Now we can count the number of photons (or electrons generated by them) by measuring the variance of digital output for a pixel.
<br>![equation 8](/assets/images/eq7.PNG)<br>
For real sensors, there are more things to consider if we are to estimate these numbers more accurately. This is where the photon transfer curve comes in at last.
<h2>
    Photon Transfer Curve
</h2>
The x axis is mean value of digital output and the y axis is variance of digital output. Ideally, this curve should be linear as stated above.

{% highlight python %}
k = 0.2
mean = []
variance = []
for λ in np.arange(0,1e4,100):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(1234)
    # an image sensor with resolution of 640 x 480 taking photons with mean of λ
    # take 10 images to calculate mean and variance
    photons_for_each_pixels = rng.poisson(λ,(10,480,640))
    digital_image = (k * photons_for_each_pixels).astype('u2')
    mean.append(digital_image.mean(axis=0).mean())
    variance.append(digital_image.var(axis=0, ddof=1).mean())
plt.plot(mean,variance,color='b')
{% endhighlight %}
<br>![ideal PTC](/assets/images/linear_ptc.png)<br>

Remember that electrons are negatively charged. They are repulsive to each other. Hence, there is a physical limit to how many electrons a photodiode can hold. This limit is called full well capacity and the phenomenon is called saturation.
{% highlight python %}
photons_for_each_pixels = np.clip(rng.poisson(λ,(10,480,640)), 0, 5e3)
{% endhighlight %}
<br>![PTC at saturation](/assets/images/fwc.png)<br>
Full well capcity is expressed as a sudden drop in varaince on the PTC. The saturated output is capped at the full well capacity with no variance. This is how we can estimate full well capacity of photodiodes by drawing a PTC.

<h2>
    Caveat
</h2>
If you have been paying close attention, you might have realized that, for these properties to mean what we think they mean, one thing has to hold true;
>Variance represents shot noise

There are other noises such as dark/thermal noise which add to variance. This means at the part of lower mean, the photon transfer curve will act differently.
{% highlight python %}
photons_for_each_pixels = np.clip(rng.poisson(λ,(10,480,640)) + rng.normal(0,10,(10,480,640)), 0, 5e3)
{% endhighlight %}
<br>![PTC at dark](/assets/images/darkPTC.png)<br>
No need to worry yet. The dark noise is usually less than 1 e<sup>-</sup> for modern pinned photodiodes. Also the shot noise is proportional to sqrt(λ) which means it will be so dominant at higher intensity that you can safely ignore the effect of the others.
The more inconspicuous yet insidious side effect comes from post processing such as smoothing filters which have effect on variance and mean.
{% highlight python %}
smoothed_image = np.array([scipy.ndimage.uniform_filter(image) for image in digital_image])
{% endhighlight %}
<br>![PTC at dark](/assets/images/filter_PTC.png)<br>
At this point, it might still look like a PTC, but it no longer represens what we are interested in, i.e. number of photons.
